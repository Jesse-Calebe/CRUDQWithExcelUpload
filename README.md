# Getting Started

Welcome to your new project.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`_i18n/` | translations
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide
`xs-security.json` | authorization roles and scopes

## Next Steps

- Open a new terminal and run `cds watch`
- (in VS Code simply choose _**Terminal** > Run Task > cds watch_)
